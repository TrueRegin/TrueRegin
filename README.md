### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I make epic interactive websites and applications, most of my stuff is either templates or projects which you can test out yourself. 

# Highlights

## [Fractal Renderer](https://github.com/TrueRegin/Fractal-Renderer)
Julia and Mandelbrot fractal generator in C++, it's about as fast as I could make it and it takes advantages of doubles in the shader so you can zoom in a good distance. Don't be fooled, fractals are incredibly simple once you understand them.

## [Sourzce](https://github.com/TrueRegin/Sourzce)
LAN Network file upload server, upload photos from your phone to your PC in a flash (or any other devices).

## [Codez Breaker](https://github.com/TrueRegin/codez-breaker)</u>
A ton of basic decoders all in one app, you can see a working prototype at [https://codez-breaker.glitch.me/](https://codez-breaker.glitch.me/)

## [Family Guy Chat](https://github.com/TrueRegin/family-guy-chat)
It's a one of a kind cursed website, don't check it out, I mean seriously the chat is also wonky and weird,

# Templates
[OpenGL Template](https://github.com/TrueRegin/OpenGL-Template) â†’ For building basic OpenGL applications, comes with a Shader compiler and image rendering system + loop already in place
[Simple Frontend Template](https://github.com/TrueRegin/Simple-Frontend) â†’ A simple frontend template you can just clone and get started, mainly for using ts + sass in a project. Bonus... Webpack makes it easy to make your site into a PWA using `webpack-workbox-plugin` and `webpack-pwa-manifest` plugins.
[Webpack Site Template](https://github.com/TrueRegin/webpack-site-template) â†’ Another simple site template made with Webpack, this one uses pug and is a bit older. Has a nice bouncing square animation.

# Other Big Projects (Currently Unpublished & Unfinished)
**Veinr** is a twitter semi-clone made with Vue

# In the Future
**Musewave** is going to be a private music website which I may make implementable
**Multastream** youtube live watch app, that's literally it
### Far Future
  **Sourzce File Client** A desktop app for managing files and managing your folders much more efficiently, will have a powerful Node file manager that allows you to easily go deep through file trees to find what you need.
