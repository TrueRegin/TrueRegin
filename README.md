### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Anthony and this is my github profile.
I'm, well, unsure about a lot of things, but I'm pretty sure I have an idea of how to build a decent website given an interesting/useful concept and some time.

You can check out my work below which consists primarily of Web projects (fullstack/frontend websites), Desktop Applications, and Templates.

âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨ Seriously, my best work is down below so go check it out! âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
I also have many more projects on my Github than those listed here if any of this interested you.

# Highlights

## [Pixel Borders](https://github.com/TrueRegin/pixel-borders)
This is a pretty nifty site, I made it back when I was interested in pixel art styles and think the background + pixel art effect turned out pretty well.
You can check out a working version at https://pixel-borders.netlify.app/. Try seeing if you can match up all the items.

## [Fractal Renderer](https://github.com/TrueRegin/Fractal-Renderer)
Julia and Mandelbrot fractal generator in C++, it's about as fast as I could make it and it takes advantages of doubles in the shader so you can zoom in a good distance. Don't be fooled, fractals are incredibly simple once you understand them.

## [Sourzce](https://github.com/TrueRegin/Sourzce)
LAN Network file upload server, upload photos from your phone to your PC in a flash (or any other devices).

## [Codez Breaker](https://github.com/TrueRegin/codez-breaker)</u>
A ton of basic decoders all in one app, you can see a working prototype at [https://codez-breaker.netlify.app/](https://codez-breaker.netlify.app/)

## [Family Guy Chat](https://github.com/TrueRegin/family-guy-chat)
It's a one of a kind cursed website, don't check it out, I mean seriously the chat isn't really good quality.

# Templates
[OpenGL Template](https://github.com/TrueRegin/OpenGL-Template) â†’ For building basic OpenGL applications, comes with a Shader compiler and image rendering system + loop already in place

[Simple Frontend Template](https://github.com/TrueRegin/Simple-Frontend) â†’ A simple frontend template you can just clone and get started, mainly for using ts + sass in a project. Bonus... Webpack makes it easy to make your site into a PWA using `webpack-workbox-plugin` and `webpack-pwa-manifest` plugins.

[Webpack Site Template](https://github.com/TrueRegin/webpack-site-template) â†’ Another simple site template made with Webpack, this one uses pug and is a bit older. Has a nice bouncing square animation.

# In the Future
**Ether ðŸ”¥** - Ether is a (currently private) music playing app I'm working on made with Electron + Vite + Vue. It is intended for streamers and music listeners.
The app will have tagging for individual songs and listening time for songs so you can turn on auto-play, apply a filter and listen to songs without being bothered.

Of course, I'm still working on the app, so I'll update this section if the app ever has a working version out.
